# Data_Preparation_Supply_Chain

In this project, I worked as a data analyst for a global supply chain company, addressing critical issues in inventory management and predictive modelling. The company faced challenges with inventory imbalances—excessive stock of “B” and “C” products, shortages of “A” products, and declining revenue due to backlogs. My task was to evaluate and enhance the data preparation strategies used in the machine learning model responsible for predicting sales returns, which is integral to the company’s inventory-level recommendations.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Assessment of Current Data Preparation Strategies:
  - Evaluated the existing data preparation process, which involved handling missing data, imputing values, and feature selection.
  - Identified limitations in the current approach, such as the need for an explicit criterion for encoding and potential oversights in handling missing data.
2. Critical Analysis and Improvement:
  - Conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis to identify areas for improvement, including investigating non-random missing data patterns and refining feature selection methods.
  - Proposed and implemented enhanced strategies for data imputation, feature engineering, and encoding to improve the dataset’s quality and the predictive model’s performance.
3. Implementation and Comparison:
  - Created a new Jupyter notebook titled “Data Preparation_Proposed Scenario” to apply the improved strategies.
  - Compared the results of the new data preparation process with the original, highlighting the differences in feature selection and the impact on the final dataset.
